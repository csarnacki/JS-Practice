JS Practice

This folder is all about my practice so far with JavaScript and JSON. There are two files that focus solely on JavaScript and my extent of understanding it.

The other file is JSON and JavaScript being used together to "extract" and "store" data as if it were on a server. 

The JavaScript contains examples that deal with for loops and while loops, arrays, conditions using both the "if" and "else" keywords and the "if" and "else if" keywords
to set each condition. There is also a little bit that deals with functions and function parameters, including an example that has a default parameter.

I plan to grow this folder as my knowledge of both JavaScript and JSON expands.
